In the following code i have used Linear regresion for predicting the number of trees required to plant due to the increase in carbondioxide emission.The data set is taken from the world bank server from 1960 to 2015.THe emissions are estimated from 2016 to 2050 and the number of trees required will be multiplied by 40000 trees.Please correct me if I am wrong.
